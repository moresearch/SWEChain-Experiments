This is because we are forcing focus here:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/313c5757160561ce7f47254097e08d9a9c208dc9/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose.js#L232-L238\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue is we are only checking for `modal.isVisible`, but the file selector is not a modal so we are always going to return focus to the composer input when the file selector opens.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\\r\\nI suggest we add a new state, `isFilePickerOpen`, which we set to true when the file picker is opened and which then will be used to block the emoji suggestions from showing. We then set it back to false when either the window receives focus (i.e. on cancel) or the `AttachmentModal` is closed. Unfortunately, when the file picker is dismissed the order of events that fire (i.e. `onChange` and window `focus`) is inconsistent between browsers/platforms, so we need a workaround (I have a few options below) to ensure it works everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst we need to update this section to add the new state and an event listener for the window regaining focus.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/313c5757160561ce7f47254097e08d9a9c208dc9/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose.js#L783-L790\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nonSelected: () =\u003e {\\r\\n this.setState({isFilePickerOpen: true});\\r\\n window.addEventListener(\\",

On native platforms, this is not the case.\\n\\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\\nEither of Solution 1 or 2 has to be selected for implementation.\\n\\n**Solution 1**\\nOn mobile web, the default behaviour when a checkbox is clicked is to blur the text input which causes the form validation to trigger since `shouldValidateOnBlur` is `true` by default. Add the following props to the `Form` component in `BankAccountManualStep` to disable validation when the text input is blurred or when the checkbox is changed (to match the behaviour on native platforms).\\n```\\nshouldValidateOnBlur={false}\\nshouldValidateOnChange={false}\\n```\\n\\n**Solution 2**\\nOn native platforms, blur the text input when the checkbox is tapped or clicked. This can be achieved with the following steps.\\n\\n1. In the [BankAccountManualStep](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/pages/ReimbursementAccount/BankAccountManualStep.js) component, add a `useRef` hook for the routing number text input.\\n```\\nconst routingNumberInputRef = useRef(null);\\n```\\nand set the ref for the `TextInput`.\\n```\\n\u003cTextInput\\n ...\\n ref={(el) =\u003e routingNumberInputRef.current = el}\\n inputID=\"routingNumber\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nProposal: 1:\\n\\n2. Add an event handler, `onCheckboxPress`\\n```\\nconst onCheckboxPress = () =\u003e {\\n if (routingNumberInputRef.current) {\\n routingNumberInputRef.current.blur();\\n }\\n};\\n```\\nand set it as the `onPress` prop for the `CheckboxWithLabel` component.\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nProposal: 2:\\n\\n3. Update the [CheckboxWithLabel](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/CheckboxWithLabel.js) component to support the `onPress` prop (add the corresponding prop type and update the `toggleCheckbox` method).\\n```\\nconst toggleCheckbox = (e) =\u003e {\\n if (props.onPress) {\\n props.onPress(e);\\n }\\n const newState = !isChecked;\\n props.onInputChange(newState);\\n setIsChecked(newState);\\n};\\n```\\nand change the `onPress` props:\\n```\\n\u003cCheckbox\\n ...\\n onPress={(e) =\u003e toggleCheckbox(e)}\\n ....\\n/\u003e\\n\u003cPressableWithFeedback\\n ...\\n onPress={(e) =\u003e toggleCheckbox(e)}\\n ...\\n/\u003e\\n```\\n\\n4. Update the `handleSpaceKey` and `firePressHandlerOnClick` methods in the [Checkbox](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/Checkbox.js) component to pass the event parameter to the corresponding onPress calls. This is optional, but recommended for the sake of completeness.\\n\\n**Solution 3**\\nBased on previous implementations of preventing loss of focus for a text input when a click is executed outside, add a `preventDefault` call for the checkbox press event and then programmatically change the value of the checkbox using a state variable. However, after testing, this doesn\\",

In other words, while opening the `select-year` route, the new page is loaded as new modal. So, another overlay is being added. It will sum up the previous overlay\\",

Since you are a manager, your task is to select the best proposal regaerding how to fix the issue from the below options:\\n\\nProposal: 1:\\n\\n## Proposal\\r\\n\\r\\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\\r\\nWhen the user enters a street that is pretty common, they can get the suggestion for the address for other countries than the one they are looking for. In this case, they might enter the locality / state / country in the address field to narrow down the search scope but when they choose the state, the address line 1 field is not updated with the chosen value.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\\r\\nThis is a pretty weird but valid case. To avoid overwriting the street input when the user has entered a detailed street address, we use this validation:\\r\\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/b08bf4883d9fdf0624dcd86798933743f4b31161/src/components/AddressSearch.js#L145-L152\\r\\n\\r\\nNow here since the value entered by the OP exceeds the street value obtained from the google search, the user provided value is kept in the address line 1 field.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\\r\\n\u003c!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS --\u003e\\r\\nIn the validation, we compare `values.street.length` where the `values.street` is `props.value.trim()`. We could potentially match and remove the city, sublocality and state from `props.value` and then calculate the length. This would ensure that we are only checking the street address entered by the user and remove the city or other stuff they entered that should not be in address line 1.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nProposal: 2:\\n\\n## Proposal\\r\\n\\r\\n### We could also potentially do nothing for this issue since it could be said to be an intentional feature\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nProposal: 3:\\n\\n## Proposal\\r\\n\\r\\n### or remove the condition altogether.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nProposal: 4:\\n\\n## Proposal\\r\\n\\r\\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\\r\\nAddress - After selecting address from drop-down Address Line is not correctly filled \\r\\n\\r\\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\\r\\nI agree with the RCA of [this proposal](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/15784#issuecomment-1463538631) we only use the suggested values when it is longer than the value from the input \\r\\n\\r\\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\\r\\nI suggest that we should remove this condition and always assign `values.street = street;`\\r\\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/657b439007004a5a128fc76df00327cb14203915/src/components/AddressSearch.js#L146-L152\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the user clicks the item from the dropdown, we will always select the suggested value from the dropdown\\r\\n\\r\\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
